# 📘 Project 1: Student Score Prediction

**📖 Overview:**
This project builds a regression model to predict students' exam scores based on study hours and other factors. The goal is to explore relationships in the dataset, clean and visualize data, and train machine learning models for prediction.

**📊 Dataset:**
Recommended Dataset: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)
Features may include: study hours, sleep, participation, previous scores, etc.
Target variable: Final Exam Score

**⚙️ Tools & Libraries:**
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

**🛠️ Project Steps:**
Data Cleaning
Handle missing values and outliers
Encode categorical variables (if any)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of scores
Correlation heatmaps
Scatterplots (e.g., study hours vs. exam score)
Modeling
Split dataset into training & testing sets
Train Linear Regression model
Evaluate with metrics: R², MAE, RMSE
Visualization
Actual vs. Predicted scores plot
Residual analysis

**🔮 Bonus:**
Try Polynomial Regression and compare results
Experiment with different features (e.g., sleep, participation)

**📌 Results:**
Linear regression achieved R² = ... on test data
Polynomial regression improved performance by ...%



# 📘 Project 2: Customer Segmentation
**📖 Overview:**
This project applies unsupervised learning (clustering) to segment mall customers into groups based on income and spending score. The aim is to understand customer behavior and provide insights for marketing strategies.

**📊 Dataset:**
Recommended Dataset: Mall Customers Dataset (Kaggle)
Features: Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score

**⚙️ Tools & Libraries:**
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

**🛠️ Project Steps:**
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing data
Scale features (StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Distribution of income & spending score
Pairplots and scatterplots
Clustering
Apply K-Means clustering
Use Elbow Method & Silhouette Score to find optimal clusters

**Visualization:**
Plot clusters in 2D (Income vs Spending Score)
Assign customer segments

**🔮 Bonus:**
Try DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering
Analyze average spending per cluster

**📌 Results:**
Optimal number of clusters found: k = ...
Cluster insights: e.g., High Income - Low Spending, Low Income - High Spending, etc.



# 📘 Project 3: Movie Recommendation System
**📖 Overview:**
This project implements a collaborative filtering recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. It recommends movies based on user similarity and evaluates the quality of recommendations.

**📊 Dataset:**
Recommended Dataset: MovieLens 100K Dataset (Kaggle)
Includes: User IDs, Movie IDs, Ratings (1–5), Movie Metadata

**⚙️ Tools & Libraries:**
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

**🛠️ Project Steps:**
Data Preprocessing
Load ratings and movie data
Create User-Item Matrix
User-Based Collaborative Filtering
Compute similarity scores (cosine similarity)
Recommend top-N unseen movies for a given user
Evaluation
Use Precision@K metric
Compare recommendation quality

**🔮 Bonus:**
Implement Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Try Matrix Factorization (SVD)
**📌 Results:**
Achieved Precision@K = ...
Example recommendations: For user X → Top 5 movies recommended were ...
